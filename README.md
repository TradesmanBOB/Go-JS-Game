  This is supposed to be a web-version of the very old Chinese game of Go. Which is an abstract strategy board game, for two players in which the aim is to control more territory than the oppponent.

This project has caused me a lot of frustration, particularly in getting the stones placed accurately on the board and ensuring the grid alings correctly with the invisible interactive board. Additionally I've faced challenges in implementing game mechanics well, such as creating opposing AI opponents and ensuring button selectors function as intended.

Next I hope to correctly finish fixing the opponent system, button selectors and grid alignment (and stone placement), afterwhich I will likely not add things unless necessary.

FYI This repo was almost entirely made with help from ChatGPT, mostly for the actual JavaScript itself as I can write HTML/CSS on my own, but due to not knowing how JS works with CSS there is a bit of that written with it as well.

I don't care what ya'll think about AI, if ya want to fix/adjust code or suggestion changes, branch or comment if you will please (not entirely sure how that works to be fair).
